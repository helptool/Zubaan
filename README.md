# Zubaan
Zuban - a living dictionary and archive of emotions, languages, and expressions. Not just meanings, but stories behind words. Every entry in Zuban breathes carrying its roots, synonyms, antonyms, poetic echoes, and timeless Urdu–English connections. It’s not a dictionary. It’s a Museum of Souls: where words remember what humans forget.
🕊️ Zuban – Museum of Souls

Where words find their afterlife.

Zuban is not just a dictionary.
It’s a living museum where each word is treated like a soul — carrying its own history, sound, meaning, and feeling.
Here, language breathes again — not through definitions, but through stories, metaphors, and memories that once gave life to those words.

🌙 Vision

To preserve, translate, and reawaken forgotten expressions from Urdu, Hindi, Persian, Arabic, and English —
by giving each word a soul of its own.

Zuban aims to become a timeless archive where:

Words are not only translated but felt.

Synonyms and antonyms live side by side like light and shadow.

Poetry, philosophy, and linguistics merge into one voice.

🔡 What You’ll Find Here

Each entry in Zuban contains:

Word (لفظ / Word)

Meaning (معنی / Definition)

Synonyms & Antonyms

Origin / Etymology

Usage Examples (from poetry, books, or film dialogues)

Cultural & Emotional Context

Every word is a chapter — not a line.

🕯️ Why Zuban?

Because language is not data — it’s memory.
Zuban keeps alive the voices that time tried to silence.
Every word in it is a story, a heartbeat, and sometimes — a goodbye.
