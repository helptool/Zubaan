# Zubaan
Zuban - a living dictionary and archive of emotions, languages, and expressions. Not just meanings, but stories behind words. Every entry in Zuban breathes carrying its roots, synonyms, antonyms, poetic echoes, and timeless Urdu–English connections. It’s not a dictionary. It’s a Museum of Souls: where words remember what humans forget.
